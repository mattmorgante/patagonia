                    <h1 class="section-heading">The Best Websites For Finding Cheap Flights to Patagonia</h1>
                    <p class="lead">There are a number of excellent search engines for comparing costs and finding a flight. In this post, I'll break down the best features of the various portals, making it easier for you to navigate your way to a cheap and painless flight.</p>
                    <hr>

                    <h2 class="section-heading2">1. Adioso.com</h2> 

                    <p class="lead">A recent discovery for me, this portal is fantastic for finding the cheapest flights when you're traveling on a flexible time frame. You can search for the lowest fares across a week or month long period, or even select the amount of time you would like to be gone for.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2 class="section-heading2">2. Skyscanner.com</h2> 

                    <p class="lead">Skyscanner is great for two reasons: finding the cheapest flights if you don't have a specific destination in mind, and the grid view for showing prices throughout an entire month.</p>

                    <a href="http://skyscanner.com/" target="_blank">

                    <hr>


                    <h2 class="section-heading2">3. Kayak.com</h2> 

                    <p class="lead">Another popular portal is Kayak.com. With an intuitive interface and a wealth of features, Kayak has a lot of great information to help plan your journey. One feature I particularly like is their advice about whether tickets will raise or lower in price during the coming weeks.</p>

                    <a href="http://kayak.com/" target="_blank">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/kayak.png" alt="best websites for finding cheap flights">

                    <hr>


                    <h2 class="section-heading2">4. Kiwi.com</h2> 

                    <p class="lead">The best part about Kiwi.com is that you can set a departure radius, so if you live in a hub with multiple airports, you can find which one has the best deals. For example, even if you live in Philadelphia, you might find that it's cheaper and easier to take the train to New York City, then depart from there.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading2">5. Hipmunk</h2>

                    <p class="lead">Hipmunk is beneficial during the flight search for estimating the hassle of your transit. They do a great job of taking multiple factors into account when planning a trip, not just the price.</p>

                    <a href="http://hipmunk.com/" target="_blank" >

                    <hr>

                    <h2 class="section-heading2">6. Google Flights</h2>

                    <p class="lead">For finding round trip tickets on exact dates and destinations, Google Flights is a great place to go. However, I'm often disappointed by the flexibility of their search capabilities.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading2">7. Kilroy Travels</h2>

                    <p class="lead">Kilroy is fantastic for youth and student discounts on popular travel routes, but make sure you qualify for their rates before getting too excited about the fares.</p>

                    <a href="http://travels.kilroy.net/" target="_blank" >

                    <hr>


                    <p class="lead">One last word of advice: if youâ€™ve been doing a lot of searching for flights, be sure to clear your cookies before making a final booking. Airlines and websites use cookies to identify users who are returning to their website, which can result in a higher fare. </p>
