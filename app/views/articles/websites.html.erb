                    <p class="lead">There are a number of excellent search engines for comparing costs and finding a flight. Try these out for your price shopping (Note: some of these are in other languages. Use google translate to ensure you book everything correctly): 

Kayak: An aggregator that provides the cheapest flights from dozens of different airlines.
Hipmunk: Another aggregator, but here you can filter for the least painful flights as well as the cheapest.
Skyscanner: If you have flexible dates, Skyscanner offers a great feature that enables users to see price fluctuations over an entire month. Just click “show whole month” in the top right hand corner. 


Momondo: Another great search portal, with estimated prices for the entire month. 
Swoodoo: This site is owned by Kayak, but it is in German and often has different fares. 
Kilroy Travels: Great for youth and student discounts, but make sure you qualify before getting too excited about their deals 
Student Universe: Another great discount website for youth and students.  

If you’ve been doing a lot of searching for flights, be sure to clear your cookies before making a final booking. Airlines and websites use cookies to identify users who are returning to their website, which can result in a higher fare. 

Also, you can always utilize websites that do the work for you. These websites specialize in finding error fares and other super low cost flights, so then you can just sit back and wait for a good price:

Secret Flying 
Cheap Flights Lab
Error Fares: this is a twitter account you can follow that posts cheap flights 

Finally, you can always avoid the expensive cost of airline tickets by paying using miles. If you’re interested in this strategy, I recommend checking out the following resources:

Some travelers may way want to explore other parts of Chile and Argentina. If you’re interested in doing so, you may save money by booking round-trip airfare to Santiago or Buenos Aires (the two capital cities), then purchase domestic connecting flights. 

For travelers on a quick trip, flying within South America will save the hassle and hours of long bus rides. Here are some of the average prices on the most popular routes, the flights that cover a long distance between major tourism ports: 

Buenos Aires to El Calafate ($150-200) 
El Calafate to Ushuaia ($90-130) 
Santiago to Punta Arenas ($75-150) 
Bariloche to Buenos Aires ($150-200)
Puerto Montt to Santiago ($100-150)
