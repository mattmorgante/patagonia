Have you ever dreamed of traveling to Patagonia? Maybe you watched a nature documentary, saw some unbelievable travel porn photos, or just spend your free time fantasizing about exploring the vast unclaimed tracs of nature at the Southern tip of Chile and Argentina. 

What are you waiting for? 

Maybe you've done research online about Patagonia and decided that it's too expensive. Advertised prices on travel websites can be prohibitive. Just check out a few examples: 

Not only do package tours charge exorbitant rates, but many hostels don't maintain an online presence and most bus companies don't have websites in English. 
But what about guide books? 

But even picking up a guide book for Patagonia might have you shuddering. The cheapest hostel in town is $25/night? There's a huge gap between publishers and reality. 

Add in all of these factors and you might end up frustrated by the planning process or just succumbing to a package tour. 

Where are the resources for budget travelers? 

I get it. Planning a trip to Patagonia can be a challenge. That's why I wrote Patagonia On A Budget. 

This book is written by someone who really did it. I traveled for 3 months in Patagonia, spending an average of $26/day without missing out on any of the top sights. 

In this book, I'll teach you everything you need to know to make your dream vacation to Patagonia a reality. You'll learn the best value for accommodation in each town, the most spectacular things to do, and the tactics for keeping it all under a budget. 

Best of all, these are the REAL PRICES, researched and personally experienced by real backpackers. 

This book will throoughly prepare you for life on the road, help you navigate while traveling, remove barriers, and provide information simply not available anywhere else.
